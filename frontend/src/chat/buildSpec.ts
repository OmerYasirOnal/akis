/**
 * The Chat-to-Build contract (pure, UI-free).
 *
 * When AKIS is genuinely offering a build, its persona emits the spec inside a fenced
 * block whose info string is `akis-spec`. The fence uses FOUR backticks so the spec body
 * may itself contain ordinary triple-backtick code examples without closing early:
 *
 *     Here's a spec you can build 👇
 *     ````akis-spec
 *     # TODO App
 *     … the spec in markdown, may include ```js code blocks … …
 *     ````
 *
 * `extractBuildSpec` keys ONLY on that fence tag — never on prose — so the contract is a
 * stable, versionable seam between the backend persona and the frontend. Detection is:
 *  - backtick-count-aware: the closing fence run must match the OPENING run, so an inner
 *    3-backtick code block inside a 4-backtick akis-spec block never truncates it
 *    (CommonMark fencing). Persona emits 4; any run of N≥3 is accepted symmetrically.
 *  - tolerant of ≤3 leading spaces on the fence lines (CommonMark indented fences).
 *  - the info string may carry extra tokens (e.g. `akis-spec v=2`), but `akis-spec-v2`
 *    (no separator) is NOT treated as the tag.
 *
 * Tolerant by design: a missing or unclosed block returns `null` so an older AKIS or a
 * partial stream degrades to a plain rendered message rather than breaking the chat.
